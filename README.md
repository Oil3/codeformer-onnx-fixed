I have no other information that it is faster and without the box. I use it in lieu of the other one and it works better.
I must have got it from some project.

It helps me because I ssh into my broken-screen-Mac M1max to do my tests in this specific field, and it's fast, but I prefer faster.

If you have informations or can explain why (resolution most probably, right?), please share.
