codeformer fp16

nov282023: It's the fp16 codeformer onnx model.

Basically FP16 (Half-precision floating point format 16bis) uses 16bits in lieu of 32bits and reduces memory usage and increasing speed.



# codeformer-onnx-fast
onnx codeformer i found in my files that is half the size and faster.

to use: rename/swap with the original model.
